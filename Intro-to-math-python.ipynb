    "Two useful packages for doing calculus in Python are Numpy (which allows for numerical computations) and Sympy (which supports symbolic manipulation). These can be used without any prior experience programming in Python (or at all), especially in the Jupyter notebook format, where code snippets can be provided for you to edit and run as needed.\n",
