# MATH2565-Tutorials-Spring22
These are the tutorial assignments which are a mixture of both python (Jupyter notebooks) and question sheets for Math 2565 tutorials. These assignments are built to run alongside the textbook [textbook](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-accelerated/part-calculus-II.html) and supported by the work of [Patrick Walls at UBC](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/).
