# MATH2565-Tutorials-Spring22
These are the tutorial assignments which are a mixture of both python (Jupyter notebooks) and question sheets for Math 2565 tutorials. These assignments are built to run alongside the textbook [textbook](https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-accelerated/part-calculus-II.html) and supported by the work of [Patrick Walls at UBC](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/).

- **Tutorial 1** {[Intro-to-math-python.ipynb](Intro-to-math-python.ipynb)}: Brief introductory notebook for students to work through and familiarise themselves with Numpy and SymPy .
- **Tutorial 2** {[Tutorial2-IntegrationTechniques.ipynb](Tutorial2-IntegrationTechniques.ipynb)}: Notebook practising trigonometric and hyperbolic substitution, and partial fraction decomposition.
- **Tutorial 3** {[Tutorial3.pdf](Tutorial3.pdf)}: Review of various techniques of integration in preparation for Test 1.
- **Tutorial 4** {[Tutorial4.pdf](Tutorial4.pdf)}: Questions concerning areas between curves and volumes of revolution.
- **Tutorial 5** {[Tutorial5.pdf](Tutorial5.pdf), [Tutorial5-ODEs.ipynb](Tutorial5-ODEs.ipynb)}: Review of areas between curves and volumes of revolution in preparation for Test 2, and a notebook for solving Ordinary Differential Equations using the Euler method.
- **Tutorial 6** {[Tutorial6.pdf](Tutorial6.pdf)}
- **Tutorial 7** {[Tutorial7.pdf](Tutorial7.pdf)}
